1. git commit rule
    - one commit = one deployment

2. test
    - white box = unit test
    - black box = integrated test

3. design pattern
    - singleton : make only once
            usage : like DBCP, using number of common object, easy to share data(thread pool,cache,user config,reg data, log)
    + Is DBCP(Database Connection pool) object??
