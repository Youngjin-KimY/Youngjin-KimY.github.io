directive : special attribute which is independent with html attriute, and changing these directive controls DOM

what is html attribute(for someone who doesn't know)
def : HTMl attribute appear as name-value pairs, separated by `=`


addEventListener = `v-on`

we call it as event handler

syntax -> `v-on:name of event` = "expression which evaluates value"

`v-on` -> `@` <br>
e.g) `v-on:click` -> `@click`<br>
`v-bind` -> `:` <br> 
e.g) `v-bind:class` -> `:class`


update 2020-01-12<br>

`v-model` directive that makes two-way binding between form input and app state a breeze
`v-bind` directive keep the elements according to following contents<br>
**e.g.**<br>


index.html... <br>
`<div id="app-2"><span v-bind:title="message">
..... some content</span></div>`

app.js...<br>
`
var app = new Vue({
    el:'#app-2',
    data:{
        message:'hi'
    }
})`

-> **title has 'hi'**
